		//WHAT İS THE DİFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRİMİTİVE AND NON PRİMİTİVE DATA TYPES?
	/*Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).

A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
	 * 
	 * Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
	 * 
	 * A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter
	 * 
	 * The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.

	//Java variable names are case sensetive
	//Java variables names must start with a 'letter' or the$ or _
//After the first character in a java variable name the name can contain numbers the $ and the _
//Variables names can not be equal to reserved key words in java
	//variables names are written in lowercase
